# mRNA Influenza Vaccine Target Identification Pipeline

A reproducible bioinformatics workflow for the identification of conserved antigenic regions in Influenza A hemagglutinin proteins enabling the rational design of mRNA vaccine candidates.

---

## Overview

This pipeline automates:

- Downloading hemagglutinin (HA) sequences for major human-infecting subtypes (e.g., H1, H3, H5, H7)
- Sequence processing, alignment, and integration of metadata
- Site-wise conservation and Shannon entropy analysis
- Extraction and ranking of highly conserved peptide stretches for vaccine design
- Phylogenetic analysis and tree visualization

**All scripts are modular and can be adapted for other pathogens or proteins of interest.
